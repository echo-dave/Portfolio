# Portfolio

## What's it built with?
* HTML
* CSS styling and animations
* JQuery layout adjustmet of animations for mobile and on project hover information  

This has been a growing project as I've found time to work on tweaking the style and adding little detail functions to it. More I opted not to work with bootstrap or another framework to keep things flexible and avoid fighting with other people's defaults - they aren't inherently bad by any means, but as a portfolio piece in and of itself I'm keeping it all pretty pretty basic. 

## Why the single page?
In the current landscape I'm not sure it makes sense to have a multipage site to show off what I can do. I don't need extra pages for categorizing things at the moment and projects are going to link out to github or other places anyway.
